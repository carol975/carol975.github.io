On Sunday morning, just like Michael predicted, the clouds broke. Sunlight repainted the gray sky with an azure hue. A kettle of hawks seized the opportunity to soar in the air, celebrating the return of the Sun. 

“How long’s the drive?” I hopped onto Michael’s pickup truck. “Roughly thirty minutes. We were gonna be late, but my friends who'll meet us there are also running late, so we are on time” said Michael. I’ve definitely learned something about how Miamians handle time since I arrived.  

While en-route to the Everglades Michael started talking about his family. Roughly forty-five percent of the population in the Miami metropolitan area consist of people of Hispanic and Latino background. Michael’s family is one of them. His grandmother fled from Cuba after Fidel Castro came to power and settled in Homestead. 

“Do you speak Spanish?” I asked Michael.

“I have two grandmas. Growing up I’ve always felt closer to the one that spoke English than the one who spoke only Spanish, until the one who only spoke Spanish passed away. I started learning Spanish to find that [Cuban] part of me.” 

Identity struggles, I had my share of that growing up as a child in an immigrant family. 

“Some people want to connect with their cultural roots and some people just don’t care, and both are completely okay.”

I nodded quietly, neither to agree or disagree. 

Michael rolled down the side windows, I stuck my hand out, feeling the sentiment in the wind.

A little past 2 pm, we entered Everglades park and stopped at the meetup spot near the bank of a river along with a couple other tourists. There we met Michael’s best friend Max. Dressed in the Everglades’ park ranger uniform and an iconic Stetson hat, Max was prepared to lead a group of tourists on a trip for the first time in his career. 

“Here, take this.” Max handed me a wooden stick. It’s about one inch in diameter and just a little taller than my waist when I stand it on the ground. “You will need it to slog through the mud” said Max. 

Wait. Hold up, hold up. Slog through the mud? 

The boots Michael gave me only goes up to a little above my ankle and I didn’t wear waterproof pants. So this meant I would need to plod through this waist-high river half soaked in a mixture of sawgrass, mud and potentially water bugs while walking on the uneven limestone riverbed for the next hour. Oh did I mention there could be alligators in the water as well?! A group of defenseless humans walking in the river would be just like pizza deliveries for these hungry beasts, and they wouldn’t even tip! 

Before I left home I searched up tours in Everglades, ten out of ten results were airboat rides. The picture on every program advertised a group of happy tourists wearing t-shirts and sunglasses cruising through the calm water of Everglades while holding up smartphones taking pictures and nodding at each other as if the beauty of the nature had somewhat won their approval. 

Wasn’t I supposed to be just like one of these tourists? Sitting comfortably in a nice and dry boat enjoying the scenery passing by, occasionally pointing out an interesting-looking bird or plant to my fellow travelers and chuckle elegantly?

I didn’t sign up for a mud walk.

I looked at my Aunt who tagged along behind me, and grimaced.

And she grimaced back. She didn’t expect this either.

My fellow tourists each grabbed a stick and started forming a line behind Max. “Charge!” Max announced, giving me little time to regret and turn back. I sighed, and followed the group into the water.

The riverbed was angled at a slowly descending slope. For the first couple steps my boots were high enough to protect me from the surrounding, but on the tenth step a splash of water mercilessly entered my right boot soaking my calf completely. 

Mon dieu, it's kinda cold, I gulped. 

Another step, the water flooded into my left boot. 

Oh welp, at this point I had given up on being an elegant tourist. I made up my mind to continue the pilgrimage, to wherever Max was leading us.

The surface of the river was covered with sawgrass and shrubs of dwarf trees, so tightly packed that when looked from afar it appeared as if the area was unpruned grassfield rather than river. But when you step into the field you would see the grayish water flowing slowly through the vegetation. You could feel the hard riverbed composed of limestones with a foot of mud covering on top.

The way one should slog through a slough is like this: you hold your hiking pole or wooden stick tightly with both of your hands and stab the end of the pole into the riverbed roughly half a meter in front of you. The pole should go deep enough to touch the bottom of the riverbed. In this case you should feel the pole hitting the solid limestone under the mud. Without letting go of the poles from your hands, walk slowly toward where the end of your pole is stabbed. Pull the pole out and repeat the procedure. The only thing to remember is to move the pole first then walk, otherwise it’s very easy to lose balance. 

As we slogged further we started seeing these yellow-greenish tubular sponges floating in the water.  

“I got questions!” Someone shouted.

“And I got answers!” Max shouted back cheerfully

“What are these booger-looking sponges?”

“Oh these, these are Periphytons!” 

Periphyton is a type of algae, Max explained, it conducts photosynthesis with energy from the Sun and releases oxygen to the water. The fishes, tadpoles and aquatic insects all depend on these oxygen to survive. It is also a source of food for various herbivores in the ecosystem. The periphyton is a key component in Everglades’ food web. 

I took the courage and squeezed one periphyton with my bare hand, it was so soggy. But hey, those airboat riders didn’t get to touch it! 

As we walked further into the river the water turned clearer. The periphytons disappeared, short shrubs were gradually replaced by a forest of tall Cypress trees. These Cypress trees grow in water and have their roots deeply integrated with the limestone bedrocks. I put my hand on the trunk of one of the trees, feeling its rough surface. Definitely something I wouldn't get to touch if I was on an airboat ride. The boat wouldn't be able to navigate through the trees and the noise from the boat would probably disrupt the peace in this secretive world. 

Yes, peace. 

We were so far into the slough that no cars or other human beings could be seen. No bustle from the city could be heard. We were simply enfolded in tranquility. 

“Take a deep breath, close your eyes and take in the world around you.” Said Max. 

I did as told. The wind brushed over the trees in a soothing cadence. The sunlight that shone through the branches caressed my face with its gentle warmth. The water around my legs stood still. All things patiently waited for me to take them into my soul.

I felt calm. 

When I was small I used to be able to sit still and watch a mechanical clock tick for an entire minute, while thinking absolutely nothing else. But it's impossible for me to do the same now. I’d spend ten seconds looking at the clock hand, ten seconds thinking about the food I want to eat, another moment dreading on replying to text messages and emails, and eventually abandoning the clock for a youtube video. I couldn’t feel calm anymore. 

“When was the last time you passed by nature and took time to appreciate it?” Asked Max.

I don’t know, I said quietly to myself. Perhaps I need to start learning how to flush thoughts on my mind out of me and start taking time to engage with nature again. 

As we started heading back, Max started humming the famous song by Kingston Trio, “but he better keep movin' and don't stand still. If the 'skeeters don't get then the 'gaters will. Runnin' like a dog through the Everglades.”

Ay, it was a wonderful adventure. Hail the Everglades!
