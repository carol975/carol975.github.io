Hiya, my name is Carol, I am a software engineer from Canada. I'm also an amateur ultimate frisbee player, aviation enthusiast, a hip-hop dancer, and a polyglot. (Yes all amateur level :)). I set up this little blog to capture thoughts I have on random things. Thanks for popping by, I'm glad you came!
